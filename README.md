## Current Concept and IQ Generating Process üîÑ
I follow a structured approach to sharing knowledge on Threads, posting concepts and thought-provoking questions (IQs) that stem from my professional experience, academic background, and interview scenarios. These questions are either ones I have encountered, been asked in interviews, or would consider posing in a data science discussion. I refine each question to maximize conceptual coverage and, at times, deliberately choose intellectually stimulating topics to encourage deeper engagement.
